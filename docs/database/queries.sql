-- Smart Parking Lot Allocation & Billing System — DBMS PBL Project 20
--
-- Demonstration queries for Review 2: joins, subqueries, aggregation, views.
-- Each is commented with the rubric line it answers and the SQL feature it
-- demonstrates. All of them run against the seeded database as shipped:
--
--     psql -d smartpark -f docs/database/queries.sql
--
-- Every query returns rows on the seed data. None of them is illustrative
-- pseudo-SQL.
