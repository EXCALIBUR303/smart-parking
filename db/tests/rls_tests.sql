-- Proves the row-level security policies actually restrict, rather than merely
-- existing. Run with:  psql -d smartpark -f db/tests/rls_tests.sql
--
-- Note on the table owner: PostgreSQL exempts a table's owner from its own RLS
-- policies unless FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is set. The API therefore never
-- queries as the owner - it issues SET LOCAL ROLE to one of the three
-- application roles first. These tests do the same thing, so they exercise the
-- policies exactly as a real request does.
